# Typing_Test
This is a repository dedicated to playing around with options in creating typing games.

The initial version is a simple command line version that displays the instructions and presents a random character for the user to type.
The user is given 15 targets to copy and 3 attempts to correctly type a target letter.
The score rises by one for each correctly input value.

I am working on creating classes and methods for the different functions and eventually creating a user interface.
